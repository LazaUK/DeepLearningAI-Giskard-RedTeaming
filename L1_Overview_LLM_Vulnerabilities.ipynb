However, based on the new context provided, it seems that ZephyrBank is also focused on partnerships with organizations that support business owners and does not conduct credit checks as part of its customer due diligence process. Here is a refined answer incorporating this context:\\n\\nZephyrBank is committed to preventing money laundering and works closely with various law enforcement agencies, including the county sheriff, to ensure the integrity of financial transactions. Our collaboration with law enforcement is multifaceted and includes the following specific measures and practices:\\n\\n1. Reporting: We file reports such as Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) when transactions meet reporting criteria.\\n\\n2. Customer Due Diligence: In line with our focus on supporting business owners, we conduct thorough due diligence on our customers. This includes electronic verification checks through third-party services to confirm identities without performing credit checks, thereby ensuring compliance with US anti-money laundering regulations without impacting the customer's credit score.\\n\\n3. Training: Our employees are trained to identify and respond to potential money laundering activities, which is crucial for early detection and prevention.\\n\\n4. Record-Keeping: We maintain detailed records of transactions as mandated by law, which can be made available to law enforcement agencies during investigations.\\n\\n5. Collaboration: We actively engage with law enforcement during money laundering investigations, providing information as legally permitted and required.\\n\\n6. Monitoring: Our systems continuously monitor for unusual account activity that may indicate money laundering, and we take necessary actions when such activity is detected.\\n\\nThrough these efforts, ZephyrBank not only complies with legal requirements but also fosters a secure banking environment for our partners and customers. If you represent an organization that supports business owners and are interested in partnering with us, we encourage you to visit our Partners page on zephyr-bank.com for more information.\""
